## Introduction

**uFree** is a collaborative group project designed to make event scheduling and planning with friends or any group of your choice as seamless as possible. Whether you're organizing a casual hangout with friends, a study group session, or a business meeting, uFree takes the hassle out of finding the perfect time when everyone is available.

Imagine the typical scenario: You want to plan an event, but your friends or colleagues have busy and conflicting schedules. Coordinating everyone's availability can be a logistical nightmare. uFree simplifies this process by analyzing each attendee's schedule and finding a common free time slot for the event.

With uFree, you can effortlessly schedule events, see your friends' availability, and easily agree on a suitable time for everyone. Say goodbye to endless back-and-forth messages trying to find a suitable time. Let uFree do the hard work for you.
