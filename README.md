## Introduction

**uFree** is a collaborative group project designed to make event scheduling and planning with friends or any group of your choice as seamless as possible. Whether you're organizing a casual hangout with friends, a study group session, or a business meeting, uFree takes the hassle out of finding the perfect time when everyone is available.
